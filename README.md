# micromake

This is an ultra light weight build system that acts sort of like make. 

# Compiling and Running
This application is built using Haskell and Stack. So make sure that you have those installed. Then, just run `stack build` and then `stack install` to build and install the executable. After that, you should be able to execute the command `micromake -v` to get version details.

For help using the application run `micromake -h`.
